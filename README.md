Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository contains documentation for Task 2 of my internship, which focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovering meaningful patterns in datasets.

Task Overview

In Task 2, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset of my choiceâ€”such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends within the data.

Skills and Knowledge Gained

This task enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing and EDA techniques. It helped me strengthen my skills in cleaning datasets, analyzing variable relationships, and extracting actionable insights from raw data.
